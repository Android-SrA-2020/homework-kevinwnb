Question 1
If you pass arguments from Fragment A to Fragment B without using Safe Args to make sure your arguments are type-safe, which of the following problems can occur that might cause the app to crash when the app runs? Select all that apply.

==> Fragment B requests data that Fragment A doesn't send to it.
Fragment A might send data that Fragment B hasn't requested.
==> Fragment A might send data that's a different type than Fragment B needs. For example, fragment A might send a string but Fragment B requests an integer, resulting in a return value of zero.
Fragment A uses different parameter names than Fragment B requests.


Question 2
What does the Safe Args Gradle plugin do? Select all that apply:

Generates simple object and builder classes for type-safe access to arguments specified for destinations and actions.
==> Creates Navigation classes that you can edit to simplify the passing of parameters between fragments.
==> Makes it so you don't need to use Android bundles in your code.
Generates a method for each action that you've defined in the navigation graph.
Prevents your code from using the wrong key when extracting data from a bundle.


Question 3
What's an implicit intent?

A task that your app initiates in one fragment in your app, and that's completed in another fragment.
A task that your app always completes by showing the user a chooser.
==> A task that your app initiates without knowing which app or activity will handle the task.
An implicit intent is the same thing as the action that you set between destinations in the navigation graph.
